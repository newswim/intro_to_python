# Python has meaningful white space

# If you want to create a branching program, the most rudimentary
# means of doing so is if/else statements. They look like...

numb = int(input('pick a number between 1 and 10'))
if numb > 5:
    print('Too many cooks in the kitchen.')
else:
    print('This is manageable.')

# >> out: Too many cooks in the kitchen.
# or
# >> out: This is manageable.
